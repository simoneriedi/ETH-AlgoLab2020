# ETH-AlgoLab2020
This repository contains my solutions to the problems from the ETH course AlgoLab in 2020/2021. 
This course has a strong focus on competitive programming and restricted time management, 
as it requires the students to solve several programming exercises in C++ under time constraints.
The ideas covered in the course range from sliding window, dynamic programming, greedy strategies and the use of libraries such as CGAL and BGL, to tackle flow,
linear programming, graph and geometric tasks.
All my solutions give 100 points on the judge, with the general goal of writing concise and clean code.
